# Usage
Simply hit the jump button as you hit a wall in mid-air to trigger the trick. By default, you will be able to air dash and air boost again after hitting a wall plant, and every wall plant you do in a row without landing/grinding/wallrunning/etc. beforehand will get weaker. You can do up to 4 in a row.

# Configuration
A documented BepInEx configuration file will be created the first time you run the mod, called "com.LazyDuchess.BRC.WallPlant.cfg". You can use r2modman to more easily edit it.
